# LECHO- Your New Linux Assist!!

This program is created to provide a virtual assistant for linux based systems.
The user speaks/types a sentence and the program responds accordingly.

**To run the program:**

	python3 lecho.py
	
  
**System requirements:** 

•	Active internet connection

•	Latest Chrome browser

•	Microphone


**Overview:**

 a) Search online for "query" - Searches for the string 'query' online. Opens chrome.
 
 b) What is the time/day/date - Tells the time/day/date respectively.
 
 c) Where is "place" - Opens a new tab on chrome and displays the location of 'place' in google maps.
 
 d) Bye - quits the program
 


**For further upgrades:** 

Modify the assistant() function in the program and add more ‘elif’ conditions.

(Or you could possibly add some Machine Learning and make it intelligent!!)
